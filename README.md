# Encryption at Rest Project
Overview

The Encryption at Rest project provides a secure solution for encrypting and decrypting files at rest using a symmetric encryption algorithm. This project ensures the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data stored on disk by encrypting files with a secret key and salt. The key rotation mechanism further enhances security by periodically rotating the encryption key.
Features

    Encrypt files with a secret key and salt
    Decrypt encrypted files using the same key and salt
    Periodic rotation of encryption keys to mitigate risks
    Secure storage of encryption keys in a keystore
